# Overview

As a Computer Scientist, I made a website that could interact with users.  

This project demonstrates the implementation of JavaScript with the combination of Web Development. 
The different ways JavaScript could be used is limitless. 
In this project, I will demonstrate how to check if numbers are prime numbers, if a digit is a Factorial number, and reading information on other websites.

My purpose for this software is to be able to take user information and be able to handle and interoperate information.
I wanted to see how different languages were able to work insync together.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript and Html
- **Additional Libraries**: None

JavaScript  is a backend language that can  make any website enjoyable. 
Alone, it is not able to do anything. But in combination with Html, it can do anything your mind can think of.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I need to understand the types of website security to read information on.
- In the future, I could add a selection of numbers for the user to choose from 
instead of asking the user to input numbers and possibly breaking the program.
- I need to improve on how to import data from other documents with JavaScript.
